    "_**Houston**_ is the fourth most populous city in the USA, located in the state of Texas with the population more than 2.3 million. It is recognized worldwide for its oil and natural gas industry and biomedical research, such as the MD Anderson Cancer Center, as well as the famous National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). [[1](#1)] Besides, Houston is a kid-friendly city with the Houston zoo, many beatiful parks, and different kinds of museums. It's also a foodie-friendly city with restaurants of versatile styles and anyone can find his/her prefered ones in this city. In such a big city, how to find neighborhoods that fulfill your needs? If one wants to start a business, such as opening a restaurant, in Houston, how to choose the suitable location?"

    "In this project, I will study the neighborhoods in Houston, especially the restaurants. I will try to find the popular restaurants and possible candidate locations for opening a restaurant. Since there are many restaurants already in Houston, my goal will be to identify locations that are not crowded with restaurants of particular interest. Particularly, a location that doesn't have that kind of restaurants yet will be the most promising candidate. And the population should be another element that should be considered. I will use the neighborhood data to generate the most promissing neighborhoods as the candidates based on the above criteria. Also I will clearly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each candidates, so the stakeholders can choose the best possible locations."

Then the locations of latitudes and longitudes will be obtained by \"geopy.geocoders\" from Google. Together with the population data of each super neighborhood, a dataframe will be created. After these pre-processing, I will use the Foursquare API to get all venues for each super neighborhood, for which I will select all the venues with category containing \"Restaurant\". By using the K-means clustering, I will analyze all restaurants in Houston and visulize the locations of different clusters on Houston map. Through these analysis, I can have clear idea for the candidate locations where to open a new restaurant business."
